# froid
some sort of project over winter break!

## current ideas 
- machine learning
  - white noise generation
  - stock market predictions 
- uic
  - make something like piazza
  - work with my bot implementation for trackers discord (typescript)
  - try to go through some upper level cs class curriculum (251, 3xx, etc)
- math
  - do something with 3b1b's library
  - conway's game of life 

- Using API
  - Create program that gives details about scheduled departures arrivals/departures for something like planes/trains/buses
    - Could take commands like Action(Departures/Arrivals)/Company(Ex: United Airlines)/Date(Ex: Today/Yesterday/09-13-20) and other parameters
    - Displays output in appropriate fashion
  - Lots of free API's out there that we can use as well: https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis
